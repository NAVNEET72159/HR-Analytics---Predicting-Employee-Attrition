## Introduction
Welcome to the HR Analytics project! In this project, we aim to predict employee attrition using data analysis and machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factors that contribute to employee attrition, we can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions to improve employee retention.

## Project Goals
🎯 Develop a predictive model to identify employees at risk of attrition
📊 Analyze key factors influencing attrition rates
🔍 Explore the relationship between employee satisfaction, performance, and attrition
📈 Provide actionable recommendations to reduce attrition and improve employee engagement

## Dataset
📂 The dataset used for this project contains information about employees, including their demographics, job-related factors, and performance metrics.
🔢 It includes features such as age, gender, education, job level, work experience, performance ratings, and more.
📋 The dataset is provided in a structured format, allowing for easy analysis and modeling.

## Methodology
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform data exploration to gain insights into the dataset and identify patterns or trends.
📊 Feature Engineering: Transform and preprocess the data to create meaningful features for the predictive model.
🤖 Machine Learning Modeling: Build and train a machine learning model to predict employee attrition.
🔎 Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and techniques.
📈 Results and Recommendations: Interpret the model's predictions and provide actionable recommendations to address attrition.
